Keep this entire exercise to gen 1. We won't ever go higher than #151

1. Display a list of the first 10 Pokemon by number. ie https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1, https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/2, etc.
2. Columns should be:
    * Number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
    * Thumbnail Image
    * Name (Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, etc.)
    * Types (one column of types: grass, poison)
3. Types should appear as badges (eg. https://serebii.net/pokedex/001.shtml) in CSS ONLY. Get as close as you can. Font is not important
4. User should be able to filter the list by text "search" (exclude items without the string in them)
5. User should be able to filter the list by type "search" (exclude pokemon who lack the selected types)

Considerations:

// Proposal? Doesn't have to be this:
{
  pokemonToFetch: 10,
  startingIndex: 1,
}

* What if, in the future, we want Pokemon 1-20?
* What if, in the future, we want Pokemon 21-41?
* What if, in the future, we want a separate part of the app to use the same pokemon data?
* What if, in the future, clicking a list item shows all of its sprites down below the list?

We want this application to keep state in redux
Pokeball keep pokemon amount state
Lets also make number searchable


change to redux
